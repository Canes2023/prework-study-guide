# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

## I created this Study Guide for boot camp students who are going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. I learned more about HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript than I thought possible. It was exciting to learn and I can't wait to start my first day. I was motivated by how organized the Prework was. Whoever made it is incredible at keeping things neat and organized.
