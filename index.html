       <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
       <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
       <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
       <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
       <li>When we build a website, we build it step-by-step in much the same way as you build a house. First, we use HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frameâ€™s building blocks. Next, we add CSS to define the style. Finally, we add JavaScript to our HTML structure to make the website interactive.</li>

       <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
       <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
       <li>Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
     </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your Git notes here</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li> Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        </ul>
